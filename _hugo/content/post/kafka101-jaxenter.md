In October an introduction to Apache Kafka called "Kafka 101" written by Frank and me got published in issue 08/2015 of the german "Java Magazin". The article itself introduces the basic concepts and methodologies used in Kafka, plus simple examples to _publish_ &amp; _consume_ messages.

Mentioned article also got published online: <a href="https://jaxenter.de/kafka-101-28692" target="_blank">JAXenter.de</a>. The example source code can be found at GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/kafka101/java-news-feed" target="_blank">https://github.com/kafka101/java-news-feed</a>
