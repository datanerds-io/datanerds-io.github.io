In October an introduction to Apache Kafka called "Kafka 101" written by Frank and me got published in issue 08/2015 of the German "Java Magazin". The article itself introduces the basic concepts and methodologies used in Kafka, plus simple examples to _publish_ &amp; _consume_ messages.

Mentioned article also got published online: [JAXenter.de](https://jaxenter.de/kafka-101-28692). The example source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/kafka101/java-news-feed).
