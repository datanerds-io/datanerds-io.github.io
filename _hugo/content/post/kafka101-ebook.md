During 2015 Frank, Tobias and I published multiple articles in the german "Java Magazin" which cover Apache Kafka related topics such as: basic fundamentals, the use of the _schema-registry_ and the simple _rest-proxy_. S&S Media decided to combine those in a lightweight [eBook](https://entwickler.de/press/apache-kafka-191983.html) which is also available in the [Kindle-Shop](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B018ER1AXQ). The used sample source code can (as always) be found at GitHub: [Messaging](https://github.com/kafka101/java-news-feed), [schema-registry](https://github.com/kafka101/clickstream-schema) &amp; [rest-proxy](https://github.com/kafka101/clickstream-rest-proxy).
