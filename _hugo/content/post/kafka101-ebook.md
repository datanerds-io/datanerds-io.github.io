During 2015 Frank, Tobias and I published multiple articles in the German "Java Magazin" which cover Apache Kafka related topics such as basic fundamentals, the use of the [Schema Registry](http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/schema-registry/docs/index.html) and the [REST Proxy](http://docs.confluent.io/2.0.0/kafka-rest/docs/index.html). S&S Media decided to combine those articles in a lightweight eBook which is available in their [online store](https://entwickler.de/press/apache-kafka-191983.html) as well as in the [Kindle Shop](http://www.amazon.de/dp/B018ER1AXQ).

The sample source code can (as always) be found on GitHub: [Basic Messaging](https://github.com/kafka101/java-news-feed), [Schema Registry](https://github.com/kafka101/clickstream-schema) &amp; [REST Proxy](https://github.com/kafka101/clickstream-rest-proxy).
