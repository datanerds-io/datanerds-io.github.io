      <description>&lt;p&gt;In late 2014 DataStax published a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/consensus-on-cassandra&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which they explain how Cassandra can be leveraged in order to reach consensus in a distributed environment. A detailed explanation can be found in mentioned article. In essence, a distributed lock or mutex mechanism to enforce that only one resource in a distributed and concurrent environment can be changed at the same time. Inspired by said article &lt;em&gt;LACK [luhk]&lt;/em&gt; was implemented. It is a very thin Java API on top of a few Cassandra queries. It is not meant as a consensus library such as libraft or atomix. We just needed something implemented fast and on top of Cassandra.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
